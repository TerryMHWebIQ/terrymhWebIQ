# Hi, I'm Terry 👋

## Fixing Marketing Measurement, One Data Pipeline at a Time

I help businesses answer the question: **"Is our marketing actually working?"** — which is surprisingly difficult when attribution is broken, dashboards conflict, and nobody connects marketing spend to revenue outcomes.

### What I Do

**Founder @webiqanalytics (https://webiqanalytics.com)
** — Marketing measurement & analytics consultancy

I specialise in:
- 📊 **Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM)** — Bayesian & frequentist approaches using PyMC-Marketing, Meta's Robyn, Google's Meridian
- 🔧 **Analytics Engineering** — Building scalable data transformation pipelines with dbt, SQL Mesh, DuckDB
- 🎯 **Conversion Optimisation** — Statistical testing frameworks & experimentation infrastructure
- 📈 **Analytics Implementation** — Server-side tracking, GA4, GTM, data governance


### Tech Stack

**Analytics & MMM:**
```

```

**Data Engineering:**

```

**Infrastructure:**

### Key Insights I've Learned

- Marketing measurement requires 3 distinct skillsets: technical execution, statistical analysis, strategic translation — most businesses can't hire all three
- Broken attribution costs UK businesses millions in misallocated spend (GA4 revenue tracking issues, pixel problems, lack of monitoring)
- Framework-agnostic MMM expertise > being locked into a single methodology
- "Fixing foundations before execution" beats "move fast and break things" in marketing analytics

### Featured Work

- **Bayesian MMM Implementation** — PyMC-Marketing hierarchical model for multi-channel attribution
- **Frequentist MMM Framework** — Meta Robyn implementation with custom priors
- **Geo-level Analysis** — Google Meridian implementation for regional campaign analysis
